# Student Performance Analysis

A Python-based data analysis project to evaluate and visualize student academic performance using multiple datasets including attendance, study hours, marks, and technical skills.


## Project Description

This project analyzes student data to identify key factors affecting academic success. Using datasets such as CGPA, attendance records, hours of study, and technical exam scores, it provides insights through data processing and visualization.

## Files Included

- `dataset.py` — Script to load and preprocess datasets  
- `std_performance.py` — Main analysis and visualization code  
- `.csv` files — Contain raw data on student attendance, study hours, marks, technical skills, etc.  
- Additional helper scripts or data files as needed  

## Technologies Used
- Python  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)  
- Jupyter Notebook / VSCode (for running and editing code)

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Mahima274/Student-Performance-Analysis.git
Navigate to the project directory:

cd Student-Performance-Analysis
Make sure you have the required Python packages installed:
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
Run the analysis scripts or open the Jupyter notebooks in VSCode or Jupyter:
python std_performance.py
or open .ipynb files in VSCode/Jupyter and run cells.
